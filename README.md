# Network Security Scanner
A lightweight Python tool for identifying open ports and active services on a network host.

## Features
- Scans common administrative and web ports (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.).
- Built using Python's native `socket` library.
- Provides clear terminal output for security auditing.

## Why I built this
To demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the TCP/IP suite and how network protocols interact with system security.

## How to use
1. Run `python scanner.py`
2. View the status of common ports on the target IP.
